# AntiqueAtlasExtras

At first i just wanted some extra information (like biome, position and time) when playing with <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/antique-atlas">Antique Atlas</a> mod. Whil searching for a potential addon mod didn't yield anything to solve my problem, i also found a cool mod named <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/signposts">Signposts</a> which is sadly only available for version 1.7.10 of minecraft.
So after i implemented my original thought, i also made crossmod compatibility between <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/antique-atlas">Antique Atlas</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/signpost">Signpost (by Gollorum)</a> and <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/waystones">Waystones (by BlayTheNinth)</a>. To release the whole thing i need to wait for AntiqueAtlas team to accept my <a href="https://github.com/AntiqueAtlasTeam/AntiqueAtlas/pull/202">pull request</a> which extends their api.
